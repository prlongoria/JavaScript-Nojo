// Coding Challenge #1
// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
// and height in meter).
// Your tasks:
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
// versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
// Test data:
// § Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
// m tall.
// § Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
// m tall.
// GOOD LUCK 

let massMark = 95;
let massJohn = 85;

let heightMark = 1.88;
let heightJohn = 1.76;

let bmiMark = massMark / heightMark ** 2;
let bmiJohn = massJohn / heightJohn ** 2;

let markHigherBMI = bmiMark > bmiJohn;

console.log(markHigherBMI);//Data 1:true/Data 2:false
